    "## Introduction\n",
    "Brief overview of analysis purpose\n",
    "This exploratory data analysis investigates global CO₂ emissions responsibility using total emissions, per-capita emissions, and cumulative historical contributions. The purpose of this analysis is to understand how responsibility for climate change differs between countries when viewed from different perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on data from 1990 onwards to align with international climate policy baselines. Insights generated from this stage will inform the design of the interactive dashboard and support clear communication of fairness, accountability, and long-term emissions trends."
